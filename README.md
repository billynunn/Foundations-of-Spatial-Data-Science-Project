# Important Information
Acclaimed for its interdisciplinary standpoint, radial-decay refers to the lessening of an observed quantity with increasing distance from a central point. It provides a unique way of investigating spatial and temporal variation of PM2.5 concentrations across London. There are currently no published power-laws that express the rates of PM2.5 radial-decay in London. Therefore, the overall aim of this study was to create the first. Within this repository, the full code from the exploratory data anlaysis conducted can be found.

Disclaimer: this code is not intended to present a definitive or fully validated way of analysing spatail and temporal variation of PM2.5 concentrations in London.

# Key Features
This repository includes details on: 
- the cleaning of raw data;
- the creation of a radial-decay power law at diferent levels of aggregation;
- how the Spearman's test was conducted;
- the percentage change between PM2.5 concentrations from 2013, and PM2.5 concentrations from 2019.

# Requirements
JupyterLab Python 3.10+
